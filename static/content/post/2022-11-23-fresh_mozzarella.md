## **Culinary Uses**

Fresh mozzarella is a culinary muse, inspiring creative dishes and elevating classics. Its versatility makes it a cherished cheese among chefs and home cooks alike. Here are some common ways fresh mozzarella can star in your meals:

2. **Margherita Pizza**: The cornerstone of Neapolitan pizza, the Margherita, features juicy tomato sauce, aromatic basil leaves, and generous slices of fresh mozzarella. When baked to perfection, it yields a symphony of flavors.

3. **Stuffed and Fried**: Fresh mozzarella embraces versatility. It can be stuffed into chicken breasts, breaded, and fried until golden and oozing. This delightful indulgence promises an explosion of cheesy goodness in every bite.

4. **Antipasto Platter**: A delightful addition to any charcuterie board, fresh mozzarella adds a creamy element alongside cured meats, olives, marinated vegetables, and crusty bread.

Fresh mozzarella cheese traces its origins back to Italy, specifically the Campania region, where it was created in the 12th century. Traditionally made from buffalo milk, fresh mozzarella was a specialty of Italian cheesemakers. Over time, it gained international popularity and is now made from various types of milk, including cow, goat, and sheep.

It's worth noting that authentic Mozzarella di Bufala Campana DOP is protected by European Union law, ensuring strict adherence to traditional production methods and the exclusive use of buffalo milk from designated regions in Italy.
