You can also use it as a delicious topping for vegetables, steamed rice, or a baked potato.

### 3. Sautéing and Frying

Soy margarine's high smoke point makes it an excellent option for sautéing and frying. It adds flavor to your favorite stir-fries and lends a beautiful golden-brown color to pancakes, French toast, or grilled sandwiches.

### 4. Sauces and Roux

When making sauces or roux, soy margarine can be used as a substitute for butter as it provides the necessary fat content and texture. From classic béchamel to rich gravy, soy margarine will help you achieve creamy and velvety results.

Furthermore, soy margarine is a source of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, which play a crucial role in supporting heart health. Additionally, many brands fortify their soy margarine with essential vitamins and minerals, such as vitamin E and vitamin B12.
