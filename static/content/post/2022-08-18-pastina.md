Acini di pepe, which means "seeds of pepper" in Italian, is a type of pasta that resembles small spherical grains. Despite its unassuming appearance, these tiny pasta pearls pack a delightful taste and texture. When cooked to al dente, acini di pepe offers a tender and slightly chewy bite. Its neutral flavor allows it to soak up the surrounding ingredients or sauces, making it a versatile addition to countless dishes.

## Common Uses in Cooking

Due to its diminutive size and quick-cooking nature, acini di pepe is most commonly used in soups.
