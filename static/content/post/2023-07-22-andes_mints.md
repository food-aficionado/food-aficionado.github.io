- Origin: Andes mints are a type of chocolate mint candy that was introduced by the Andes Candies company in the United States in 1950. It is named after the Andes Mountains, which run through South America.

- Common Uses: Andes mints are often enjoyed as an after-dinner mint or as a treat during the holiday season. They are also commonly used as a topping for desserts such as cupcakes, brownies, and ice cream. Some people also incorporate Andes mints into baking recipes such as cookies or fudge.

- Nutritional benefits: Andes mints are primarily made from chocolate, sugar, and peppermint oil. While they are delicious, they are not considered a health food. They are high in sugar and calories, and do not provide significant nutritional benefits.

- Unique Properties: One unique property of Andes mints is their distinctive layering. Each mint consists of a layer of creamy chocolate sandwiched between two layers of mint-flavored chocolate. This layering gives them their distinctive flavor and texture.
