### 1. Smoothies and Shakes

Low fat peanut butter is a fantastic addition to your morning smoothie or post-workout shake. It not only adds a delightful nutty taste but also contributes a dose of healthy fats and protein. Pair it with bananas, cocoa powder, and almond milk for a deliciously satisfying treat.
