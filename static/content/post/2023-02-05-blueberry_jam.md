Native Americans were known to make a type of blueberry preserves by cooking blueberries with honey or maple syrup. Early settlers continued this tradition and blueberry jam became popular across the country.

- **Common Uses**: Blueberry jam is commonly used as a spread for toast, bagels, and biscuits. It can also be used as a filling for pastries, tarts, and cakes. Blueberry jam is often a key ingredient in desserts like pies and crumbles. It can even be used as a glaze for meats, such as pork or poultry, to add a touch of sweetness.

- **Nutritional Benefits**: Blueberries, the main ingredient in blueberry jam, are known for their high antioxidant content. They are also a good source of dietary fiber, vitamin C, and vitamin K. Blueberries are low in calories and fat, making them a healthy choice. However, it’s important to note that jam is typically high in sugar, so it's best consumed in moderation.
