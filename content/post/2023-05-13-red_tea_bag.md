This color is visually appealing and can enhance the enjoyment of drinking the tea. Red tea also has a naturally sweet and slightly nutty flavor, often described as being similar to vanilla. Because of its flavor profile, it can be enjoyed both hot and iced.

- **Historical Significance**: Red tea has a long history in South Africa. It was traditionally used by the indigenous Khoisan people for its medicinal properties. The cultivation and commercialization of red tea began in the early 20th century when it gained popularity among European settlers in South Africa.
