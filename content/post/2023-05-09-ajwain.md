Ajwain seeds contain essential oils, such as thymol and terpenes, which possess antimicrobial and antifungal properties. These oils not only contribute to the seed's unique flavor but also have potential health benefits, such as boosting the immune system and aiding respiratory health.

However, it's worth noting that while ajwain seeds offer potential health benefits, they should be consumed in moderation, just like any other ingredient.

Ajwain seeds have also found their way into numerous folk remedies and home remedies. For example, in some households, a mixture of ajwain seeds and jaggery (a type of unrefined sugar) is believed to alleviate menstrual pain and cramps.

Furthermore, ajwain seeds have a fascinating historical significance. Ancient Egyptians used ajwain seeds in the embalming process. These seeds were found among the belongings of Tutankhamun, an Egyptian pharaoh. The discovery showcases the enduring presence of these seeds throughout history.

## **In Conclusion**
