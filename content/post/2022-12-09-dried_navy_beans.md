Dried navy beans have a fascinating history that dates back centuries. Originating in South America, they were brought to Europe by Spanish explorers during the 15th and 16th centuries. They eventually made their way to North America, where they became a staple during the American Civil War due to their affordability and long shelf life.

The name "navy beans" originates from their extensive use in the United States Navy, where they were a dietary staple for sailors on long voyages. An interesting tidbit is that these beans reportedly gained popularity after being used to make a hearty stew known as "Navy Bean Soup" in the United States Senate cafeteria.
