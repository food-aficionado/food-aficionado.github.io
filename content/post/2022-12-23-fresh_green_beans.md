- **Common Uses**: Fresh string beans are versatile and can be used in a variety of dishes. They are often steamed, boiled, stir-fried, or sautéed as a side dish. They are a key ingredient in dishes like green bean casserole, salads, stir-fries, and many more.

- **Nutritional Benefits**: Fresh string beans are low in calories and rich in several nutrients. They are a good source of dietary fiber, vitamin C, vitamin K, and folate. They also contain minerals such as potassium, iron, and manganese. Furthermore, they contain antioxidants and other compounds that have been linked to various health benefits.

- **Unique Properties**: String beans got their name from a string-like fiber that used to run along the seam of the pod.
