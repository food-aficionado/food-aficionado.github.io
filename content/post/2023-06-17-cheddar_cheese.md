It also melts well and is commonly used in macaroni and cheese, casseroles, and other baked dishes. Additionally, cheddar can be enjoyed on its own or paired with fruits, crackers, and wine.

- **Nutritional Benefits**: Cheddar cheese is a good source of high-quality protein, calcium, and phosphorus. It also contains significant amounts of vitamin A, vitamin B12, and selenium. However, it is important to consume cheddar cheese in moderation, as it is high in saturated fat and sodium.
