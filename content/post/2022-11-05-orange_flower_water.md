The taste is light and refreshing, evoking a sense of Mediterranean sunshine and vibrant orange groves. 

## Versatile uses in culinary creations

Orange-flower water dazzles both sweet and savory dishes alike, offering a touch of sophistication and elegance to culinary creations. Its fragrant notes complement a wide range of ingredients, enhancing flavors and awakening the senses. Here are some popular uses of orange-flower water:
