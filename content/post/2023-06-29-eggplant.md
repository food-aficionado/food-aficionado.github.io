Initially, eggplants were not widely embraced due to their bitter taste and association with the nightshade family. However, through selective breeding and culinary experimentation, the eggplant gradually gained popularity. Today, it flourishes in cuisines across the globe, inspiring countless recipes and cultural traditions.

## Fun Facts
