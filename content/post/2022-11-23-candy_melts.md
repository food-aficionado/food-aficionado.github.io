**Candy Melting Wafers**

- **Origin**: Candy melting wafers, also known as candy melts or chocolate coating, were invented by confectionery company Peter's Chocolate in the 1940s. They were initially developed as a convenient alternative to tempering chocolate for coating and dipping confections.

- **Common Uses**: Candy melting wafers are widely used in candy making and confectionery projects. They are frequently used to coat cake pops, cookies, pretzels, fruits, and other treats. These wafers provide a smooth and glossy finish and are available in a wide range of colors and flavors, making them popular for decorative purposes.

- **Nutritional Benefits**: Candy melting wafers primarily consist of vegetable fats, sugar, and powdered milk. They are not considered a source of significant nutritional benefits. It's worth noting that the nutritional profile can vary depending on the specific brand and formulation.

- **Unique Properties**: Candy melting wafers have a unique property called "tempering." This means that they can be melted and cooled without the need for tempering, which is required with pure chocolate. It allows for easier handling and ensures a smoother final finish. Additionally, these wafers offer a longer shelf life compared to real chocolate.

- **Historical Significance**: The invention of candy melting wafers revolutionized confectionery industry practices. Prior to their creation, tempering chocolate was a time-consuming process that required specific temperature control. Candy melts provided a simpler and more convenient alternative, enabling home cooks and professional bakers to achieve professional-looking results in less time.

Please note that while candy melting wafers are commonly referred to as chocolate, they are not real chocolate due to the absence of cocoa butter.
