## Taste Profile: A Perfect Balance of Sweet and Tangy

Yellow onions are known for their pungent aroma and bold flavor. When raw, they can be quite sharp and bring tears to your eyes. However, when cooked, their flavor mellows out, and they develop a delicious sweetness. This delicate balance of sweet and tangy flavors makes them a versatile ingredient that enhances a wide variety of dishes.

## Common Uses in Cooking: From Soups to Caramelized Delights

Yellow onions serve as a flavor foundation in countless recipes. They form the aromatic base for soups, stews, and sauces, infusing them with depth and richness. Sautéed yellow onions are a go-to ingredient in many stir-fries, adding a savory note to the dish. Additionally, yellow onions shine when caramelized, transforming into golden-brown, sweet delights that elevate dishes like French onion soup or onion tart.
