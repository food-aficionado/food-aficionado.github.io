In Japanese cuisine, it is famously known as "Gindara" and is highly prized for its use in sushi and sashimi. Its luscious flesh withstands different cooking methods, such as grilling, broiling, baking, or even smoking, without losing its delicate texture and flavor.

Furthermore, black cod's versatility shines through as it easily absorbs different flavors when marinated or glazed.

Interestingly, black cod played a vital role in deepening diplomatic ties between the United States and Japan. Following World War II, black cod (then known as "sablefish") became a staple ingredient in Japan during the post-war reconstruction period. This preference sparked a flourishing trade between the two nations, fostering a lasting culinary bond.
