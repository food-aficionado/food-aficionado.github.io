- **Common Uses:** Dried soybeans are versatile and used in various ways. They can be cooked whole and added to soups, stews, and salads. They can also be mashed or ground into soy flour, which is used in baking. Soy milk, tofu, tempeh, and soy sauce are also popular soybean-based products.

- **Nutritional Benefits:** Dried soybeans are highly nutritious. They are an excellent source of plant-based protein, providing all nine essential amino acids. They are also rich in dietary fiber, iron, calcium, and other minerals. Additionally, they contain omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin K, and various phytochemicals, such as isoflavones.

- **Unique Properties:** Soybeans have some unique properties that make them distinct from other legumes. One of these is their high oil content, which makes them the primary source of vegetable oil in the world.
