**Buffalo Steak**

- **Origin**: Buffalo steak, also known as bison steak, comes from the American bison (Bison bison). Native to North America, these large, shaggy-haired mammals were once found in vast numbers across the Great Plains region.

- **Common Uses**: Buffalo steak is commonly used as a high-quality alternative to beef steak. It is often prepared by grilling, broiling, or pan-searing to achieve a delicious, tender texture. Buffalo steak can be enjoyed on its own or incorporated into various recipes such as stir-fries, stews, or even served in sandwiches.

- **Nutritional Benefits**: Buffalo steak is known for its rich flavor and nutritional benefits. It is a lean meat option that contains less fat and fewer calories compared to beef. Buffalo steak is a good source of high-quality protein, iron, and various essential vitamins and minerals, including zinc, selenium, and vitamin B12.

- **Unique Properties**: Buffalo steak has a unique taste and texture. It is often described as having a slightly sweeter and more robust flavor compared to beef. The meat is typically lean, which can result in a tender yet slightly firmer texture.

- **Historical Significance**: The American bison played a significant role in the history of North America. Native American tribes relied on bison as a primary food source, utilizing every part of the animal for various purposes. The arrival of European settlers led to the near extinction of bison due to hunting and habitat loss. However, conservation efforts have helped restore the bison population in North America, and now buffalo meat, including buffalo steak, is enjoyed as a reminder of this historically important animal.
