### Courgette

- **Origin**: Courgette, also known as zucchini, belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes cucumbers, melons, and squash. It is believed to have originated in the Americas, specifically in Mesoamerica.

- **Common Uses**: Courgette is a versatile ingredient commonly used in Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, and American cuisines. It is often consumed in its immature stage when the skin is still tender and the seeds are small. Courgettes can be eaten raw, sliced and added to salads, or cooked in various ways such as grilling, steaming, roasting, sautéing, or frying. They are also popular for using in zucchini bread, soups, stews, and stir-fries.

- **Nutritional Benefits**: Courgettes are low in calories and a good source of vitamins and minerals. They contain significant amounts of vitamin C, providing about 35% of the recommended daily intake per 100 grams. They also contain vitamins A, K, and B6, as well as folate and potassium. Courgettes are also a good source of dietary fiber, which aids in digestion and can promote feelings of fullness.

- **Unique Properties**: One unique property of courgette is its high water content, which makes it particularly refreshing and helps keep the body hydrated. Additionally, courgettes are rich in antioxidants, including carotenoids like lutein and zeaxanthin, which promote eye health and may help protect against age-related macular degeneration.

- **Historical Significance**: Although courgette is most commonly associated with Mediterranean cuisine, its introduction to Europe is relatively recent. It was brought back from the Americas by Christopher Columbus during his voyages in the late 15th century, but it took several centuries for it to be widely cultivated and embraced in European cooking. Courgette was first mentioned in an Italian agricultural book in the late 1800s and quickly spread in popularity throughout Europe and the rest of the world.
