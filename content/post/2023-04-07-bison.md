## Buffalo

- **Origin:** The buffalo, also known as the American bison (Bison bison), is native to North America. It played a crucial role in the lives of indigenous peoples who depended on it for food, clothing, and shelter.

- **Common Uses:** Buffalo meat is a popular alternative to beef. It is leaner and has a slightly sweeter and richer flavor. Buffalo is commonly used in a variety of dishes, including burgers, steaks, sausages, and stews.

- **Nutritional Benefits:** Buffalo meat is a good source of high-quality protein, iron, and zinc. Compared to beef, it tends to be lower in fat and cholesterol while providing similar levels of essential nutrients. Buffalo meat is also rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which have been associated with various health benefits.

- **Unique Properties:** Unlike domestic cattle, buffalo are known for their resilience and ability to withstand harsh environments. They have a strong muscular frame, a large hump on their shoulders, and short, curved horns. The coat of the buffalo consists of a dense underfur and a longer outer layer of guard hairs.

- **Historical Significance:** Buffalo were once a dominant species on the North American plains, with an estimated population ranging from 30 to 60 million. However, widespread hunting during the 19th century nearly led to their extinction. Efforts to protect and restore buffalo populations have since been successful, and they are now considered a symbol of wildlife conservation and an important part of North American history.
