**Historical Significance:**
Pasta has been a staple in Italian cuisine for centuries, and the exact origins of bowtie-shaped pasta are uncertain. However, pasta shapes similar to farfalle have been documented as early as the 16th century. Over time, different regions in Italy developed their own variations, ultimately contributing to the diverse range of pasta shapes available today.
