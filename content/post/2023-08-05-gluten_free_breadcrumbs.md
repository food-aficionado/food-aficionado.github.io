Gluten-free breadcrumbs emerged as a necessary solution for those seeking to enjoy beloved dishes without the adverse effects of gluten.

## Interesting Facts About Gluten-Free Breadcrumbs

- **Common Uses**: Gluten-free breadcrumbs are widely used as a substitute for traditional breadcrumbs in various recipes. They serve as a binding agent, adding texture and helping to thicken and hold together ingredients in dishes like meatballs, meatloaf, veggie burgers, and casseroles. They can also be used as a coating for frying or baking foods.

- **Nutritional Benefits**: Gluten-free breadcrumbs are typically made from alternative grains, legumes, or vegetables, providing diverse nutritional benefits. For example, bread may be made from rice, corn, quinoa, or chickpeas, offering various nutrients such as fiber, protein, vitamins, and minerals.

- **Unique Properties**: Gluten-free breadcrumbs have a different texture compared to traditional breadcrumbs. They can be coarser or lighter, depending on the ingredients used. Gluten-free breadcrumbs also tend to absorb moisture more quickly, making them useful in recipes that require moisture to be retained or to prevent foods from becoming soggy.

- **Historical Significance**: The demand for gluten-free breadcrumbs has increased with the growing awareness of celiac disease and gluten sensitivity. Celiac disease, an autoimmune disorder triggered by gluten consumption, affects around 1% of the global population. The development of gluten-free breadcrumbs has allowed individuals with gluten-related dietary restrictions to enjoy dishes traditionally made with gluten-containing breadcrumbs.
