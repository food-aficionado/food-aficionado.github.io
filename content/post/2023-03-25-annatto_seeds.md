Achiote seeds are also used in traditional dishes like Mexican cochinita pibil and Filipino kare-kare.

However, it's important to note that the seeds are usually used in small quantities, so their nutritional contribution may be minimal.

They were highly regarded by the indigenous peoples of the Americas and were even used as a form of currency. Achiote seeds were also used for body paint, as they were believed to have protective and ceremonial significance. The dye extracted from the seeds was used to color fabrics and was considered sacred by some Native American tribes.

Please note that while achiote seeds have been used traditionally for various purposes, it's always important to consult a healthcare professional for specific medical advice or concerns.
