2. **Pan-Searing**: For a quick and crispy delight, pan-searing is the way to go. Season the fish with salt, pepper, and a sprinkle of paprika for added depth. Sear it in a hot skillet with a drizzle of oil, and let the exterior develop a delightful golden-brown crust while maintaining its moistness inside.
  
3. **Baking**: Baking black drum in the oven allows it to retain its moisture, creating a juicy and tender result. You can keep it simple with a lemon-herb butter sauce or get creative with complementary flavors like mango salsa or a cilantro-lime marinade.
