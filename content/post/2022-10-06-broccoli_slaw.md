- The idea behind creating broccoli slaw was to make use of the often discarded stalks, which are equally nutritious and flavorsome compared to the florets.

- Broccoli slaw gained traction due to its convenient nature for busy individuals. It offers a quick and healthy solution, as it can be purchased pre-shredded or easily prepared at home.

- Experimentation is key when it comes to broccoli slaw. Feel free to mix and match different dressings and add-ins to customize the flavor according to your preferences.
