## Nutritional Value
Garbanzo bean flour is not only delicious but also highly nutritious. It is a rich source of plant-based protein, dietary fiber, vitamins, and minerals. A 1-cup serving of garbanzo bean flour provides approximately 21 grams of protein, making it an excellent option for vegetarians and vegans.
