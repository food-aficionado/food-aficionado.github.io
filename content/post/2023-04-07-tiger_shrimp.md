Grilling, sautéing, boiling, or even incorporating them into delectable stir-fries are just a few of the countless cooking options. Tiger prawns seamlessly blend with various flavors and work wonders in both traditional and innovative recipes.

In Mediterranean cuisine, tiger prawns are often sizzled in garlic and olive oil, creating a mouthwatering aroma that heralds a flavorful feast.

## Dive into History and Facts

Exploring the history and intriguing facts surrounding tiger prawns adds an extra layer of fascination to our culinary journey. Native to the Indo-Pacific region, these prawns have been a significant part of coastal communities for centuries. They were initially harvested by traditional fishing methods but are now cultivated in farms worldwide due to their high demand.

Tiger prawns get their name from the striking patterns adorning their shells, reminiscent of tiger stripes. This distinctive visual characteristic further enhances their allure and distinguishes them from other prawn varieties.
